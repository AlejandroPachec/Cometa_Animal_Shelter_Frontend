# Frontend Asociaci√≥n Cometa (Animal Shelter)

This is the frontend of the project for a local animal shelter. Their current webpage was static and they did most of the adoption encouragement through social media. 

I wanted to help them so they can have not only a dynamic webpage but also a fully functional application where the admins can easily manage the pets looking for adoption with a user-friendly interface.
